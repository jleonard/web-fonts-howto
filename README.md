Creating custom web fonts
=========================

> **Note** the IcoMoon app can run [in the browser](http://icomoon.io/app/) or as a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icomoon/kppingdhhalimbaehfmhldppemnmlcjd). 
The Chrome extension is preferable because custom artwork is not uploaded to 3rd party servers.


##### The .svg template provided was designed for compatibility with the [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) web icon library.


## Adding Symbols
* Add your symbol to the .svg template. 
* Launch [the app](chrome-extension://kppingdhhalimbaehfmhldppemnmlcjd/IcoMoonApp.html) and import your .svg.
* **Done**

Your icons can be mixed and matched with any of the libraries provided by IcoMoon including Font Awesome.
