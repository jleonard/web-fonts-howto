Creating custom web fonts
=========================

### [IcoMoon](http://icomoon.io/#home) is free tool to create custom icon fonts for the web. 

> **Note** the app can run [in the browser](http://icomoon.io/app/) or as a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icomoon/kppingdhhalimbaehfmhldppemnmlcjd). 
> With the Chrome extension custom artwork is not uploaded to 3rd party servers.


## Adding Symbols
* Add your symbol to the .svg template. Remove the default '+' icon and center your artwork in the 14x14px square. 14px is the baseline size used to make your font compatible with [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).
* Once you've created an .svg file for each icon, launch the ico moon app and import your .svg files and then walk through the font creation process.
* **Done**

> The exported icon font is cross-browser compatible down to IE6.
