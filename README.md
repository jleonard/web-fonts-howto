Creating custom web fonts
=========================

> **Note** the IcoMoon app can run [in the browser](http://icomoon.io/app/) or as a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icomoon/kppingdhhalimbaehfmhldppemnmlcjd). 
The Chrome extension is preferable for client work because custom artwork is not uploaded to 3rd party servers.


## Install the Chrome Extension
